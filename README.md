# Detection_Segmentation_Deep_Learning_Medical_Images-TP
This lab session is dedicated to medical image analysis with deep learning. Two topics will be studied and discussed:  object detection (single-object localization) semantic segmentation For these purposes, we exploit an annotated dataset of color fundus images, called the Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD). - TP IMT Atlantique
